# Ease-Amind

Our mission for Ease-Amind is to create a tool that children with autism can use to cope with overstimulation in their enviornments. One such device that is used commmonly is the zipper. We wanted to create a digital version that allows these zippers to become more accessible


## Features

- Haptic Feedback
- Animation
- Color Changing Background

## Lessons Learned

The lessons we learned from this project were how to use haptic feedback to simulate the felling of using an actual zipper.
And we were able to learn how to manipulate sound to change pitch and speed based on the placement and speed of the user dragging the zipper.
